# PROJECT-Real-time-Attendance-Marking-System-with-Automatic-Face-Recognition-using-TensorFlow-Lite

• Leveraged a facial image dataset, employing Label Studio for meticulous annotation and utilized 
Roboflow for dataset enhancement. 


• Implemented TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API to develop a streamlined TensorFlow Lite 
model dedicated to face recognition. 


• Integrated the model for attendance tracking, ensuring real-time updates to records based on 
detected faces.
